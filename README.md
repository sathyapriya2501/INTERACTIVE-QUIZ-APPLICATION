*Project Overview*
The Simple Quiz Application is a web-based interactive quiz platform developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to test and enhance user knowledge through multiple-choice questions in a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.In its current version, the quiz focuses on Computer Science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and computational complexity. However, the application is flexible and can easily be adapted to any subject or difficulty level.

* Objectives*
Create a lightweight and responsive quiz platform.
Provide instant feedback for user-selected answers.
Track and display the user’s score in real time.
Offer restart functionality for repeated attempts.
Gain hands-on experience in front-end development.

*Technologies Used*
HTML5 – Defines the structure of the application and quiz layout.
CSS3 – Styles the application for a clean, responsive, and visually appealing design.
JavaScript (ES6) – Handles the quiz logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

* Features*
Dynamic Question Loading – Fetches each question and its answer options from a predefined array.
Instant Feedback – Highlights correct answers in green and incorrect ones in red.
Score Tracking – Updates and displays the user’s score at the end of the quiz.
Restart Option – Allows the user to retake the quiz without refreshing the page.
Responsive Design – Ensures usability on different devices and screen sizes.

* How It Works*
All questions, options, and correct answers are stored in an array in script.js.
When the quiz starts, the first question is loaded dynamically into the HTML.
Users select an answer, which is instantly validated.
Scores are updated for correct responses.
The Next button moves to the next question.
Once the quiz is completed, the total score is displayed, and a Restart button appears.

*Learning Outcomes*
Through this project, I have:
Improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Learned DOM manipulation and how to handle user interactions.
Gained experience in designing clean and responsive UI layouts.
Understood how to modularize code for better readability and scalability.

*Future Enhancements*
Potential upgrades to improve the application:
Add a countdown timer for each question.
Implement randomized question order for variety.
Include multiple categories and difficulty levels.
Save scores using local storage or integrate with a backend database.

*OUTPUT*
